## 🚀 Project Overview
This mini data engineering project explores a dataset of **Apple products** to analyze and gain insights — especially around **iPhones**.  
Built to sharpen real-world **data analysis** and **Pandas** skills by working directly with messy product data.

> “Data is the new oil — but you gotta refine it!” 🔥

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data wrangling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **CSV dataset** as the data source

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **File**: `apple_products.csv`
- **Columns** include: Product Name, Price, Rating, Specifications, etc.

---

## 📊 What This Project Does
- ✅ Loads and reads raw Apple product data
- ✅ Cleans and filters for only **iPhone** products
- ✅ Analyzes pricing trends and ratings
- ✅ Identifies top-rated, best-value iPhones
- ✅ Sets foundation for future data visualization and dashboarding

## ⚡ How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xrishis/IPhone-Mini-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.
3. Install dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
4. Run all cells and explore the insights!
